        <p id="pp1">The writing process is defined as the steps taken to produce a strong written
            work, though these steps do not have to be chronological. These steps can include
            research, notes, prewriting, drafting, peer revision, and reflection. This goal was also
            met by all three essay assignments. I began by analyzing the written works of others
            and writing notes on them. Then, I used those notes to form an argument and a thesis.
            The next step was a prewriting assignment followed by a first draft. After the first draft
            was complete, I participated in peer review sessions and consultations with my
            professor. After some personal reflection, I reworked my draft according to their
            suggestions and my new ideas. Then, I repeated the review and drafting steps until I got
            to the final product. The writing process helps me produce stronger work because it
            requires me to constantly re-evaluate what I am doing. The steps give me multiple
            opportunities to fix mistakes and clean up my argument. If I tried to turn in my first draft
            as my final draft, I would lose out on those opportunities to rethink my work. The writing
            process is something I thoroughly enjoy about writing, and the only way to learn it is to
            practice it</p>
